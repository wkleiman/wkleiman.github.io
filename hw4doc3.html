        <h1>To Kill A Mockingbird Essay</h1>
      <p>Why Jem Finch Is The Main Character In To Kill A Mockingbird.
While growing up, all people go through experiences which help us develop as human beings. This can be getting in trouble and learning from mistakes, or watching the resilience displayed by a team in a sports game. These valuable lessons rare learned throughout our youth and help us develop our character. In the novel To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, we see Jem and Scout develop as characters and learn life lessons. We see these lessons from Scout's perspective but Jem learns more from them. Jem is the main character because he is the one who develops more as a character and is often the one who the lessons are more targeted at.
In the book, we see many lessons which are learned by Jem and Scout either through their own activities or taught to them by adults. Though Scout is present throughout the whole book and sees everything, Jem is the one who does most of the actions that lead to those lessons being learned. One example is when he tore apart Mrs. Dubose’s flowers. Jem had to read to Mrs. Dubose as a punishment and this was atticus’s way of teaching Jem and Scout about courage. Atticus says “If you hadn’t fallen into her hands, I’d have made you read to her anyway. It might have been a distraction” (148). This shows how Jem is the one who is being taught and doing most of the action because Jem is the one who tore up the flowers, and Jem was the one who had to read to Mrs. Dubose and even if he hadn’t tore up her flowers, Atticus would have made Jem read to her anyway, not Scout. Even though Scout is there to watch this whole process play out, Jem is the one who does all this.
In the book, Jem seems to be the one who the lessons are more aimed at but we also notice that Jem also appears to gain more from these lessons. He is older which allows him to understand more of what is going on and also make connections at a more advanced level than Scout. This also is at a pace closer to what we as readers are understanding and so it allows us to connect more with Jem. Scout experiences these lessons first hand yet often they seem to go over her head while Jem comprehends these lessons. At one point, Jem make a huge leap with Boo Radley when he says, “I think I’m beginning to understand why Boo Radley stayed shut up in the house all this time… It’s because he wants to stay inside” (304). This had not even occured to Scout at this point in the book, in fact, even after Jem said this Scout didn’t really seem to understand what it meant until later on in the book. 
In the novel, Scout’s role is as a observer and not as a participant in many of the events. Scout also doesn’t fully process what is happening in many situations and In one of the examples with Jem having to read to Mrs. Dubose. “Jem reopened Ivanhoe and began reading. I tried to keep up with him, but he read too fast” (142). This is an example of how Scout is just there as an observer to let us see what is happening. She was sitting there, watching Jem read and not even being able to keep up herself. This is not the only scene where she takes the back seat and Jem does most of the work. A main character would not spend a lot of the book taking a backseat but would be the character like Jem, up in the front, doing the work. Scout also does not seem to be processing most of what is happening. In one scene she was trying to socialize with men who had come to lynch Tom Robinson. She did not realize this and went and started chatting with them. This was one scene where she did take a decent size role but even though she is taking a role, she still is not comprehending what is happening and is oblivious to the importance of the scene.
	Even though the book To Kill A Mockingbird is written from Scout's perspective, Jem is the main character because he develops more as a character and Scout is just a lens to watch Jem as he learns valuable life lessons. In To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee chooses to show Jems story through Scout’s eyes to make the reader to think outside the box and allows you to think creatively about whom the main character might be. Harper Lee chose Jem as the main character because he is older and could understand what was happening more. Having Jem as the main character and writing the book from Scout's perspective gives us a unique experience from many other novels and gives us a different understanding from what we would learn if it were written from Jem’s perspective.
