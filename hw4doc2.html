        <h1>Antigone Essay</h1>
       <p>How Creon and Antigone’s views on Loyalty Effect Antigone
	Loyalty is a crucial value in relationships, only earned by gaining trust and even when it has been gained, it can be lost in moments. In the play Antigone by Sophocles, we see loyalty completely alter the path of the play and destroy relationships. Creon and Antigone both feel strongly about loyalty but Antigone values personal friendships above the law of the state and Creon values the state laws more than personal friendships. This difference in values leads to the main conflict in the play. 
	The main difference in Creon and Antigone’s views on loyalty is that Creon feels loyal to the state and Antigone feels loyal to her personal relationships. Antigone shows her opinion of loyalty when she says: “And now you can prove what you are: A true sister, or a traitor to your family.” This is why she feels obligated to bury Polyneices, who is her brother, when he was left unburied even though it she was risking her life in doing so. Antigone’s views here directly oppose Creon when he says, “As for the man who sets private friendships above the public welfare, -I have no use for him either.” (197) This view stopped him from being able to understand things from her point of view and then caused him to make the law which prevented Polyneices from being buried. This caused Creon and Antigone to develop a strong hatred and contempt and eventually for Creon to imprison and starve Antigone.
	One similarity in Creon and Antigone’s feelings towards loyalty is that they both think loyalty is an extremely important characteristic in a person. Right from the start of the book, we see Creon and Antigone state their opinions on loyalty and how they view those who fall short in being loyal. In the prologue of the book we see Antigone in discussion with her sister when she says, “I am afraid not of the danger; if it means death, It will not be the worst of deaths - death without honor” (193). This shows how Antigone would risk her life in order to save face. She is saying that the worst death she could possibly imagine is a death where you were not loyal and abandoned someone in need. Creon also immediately puts his opinions out there in his speech in Scene I where he says, 
	“I have nothing but contempt for the governor who is afraid, for whatever reason, to follow the course that he knows is best for the State.” (196)
Creon immediately comes out and tells us that he believes that a ruler especially should always be loyal to the state and that he feels hatred towards anyone who backs down and diverts from the best path for the state. This shared potency means that neither Creon or Antigone will back down. It leaves them in a stalemate where Creon doesn’t want to lose the respect of the people, and Antigone doesn’t want to lose her honor.
	Creon and Antigone’s views on loyalty directly oppose each other at equal intensities which results in their feud. This conflict is resolved in the end because of human nature. People naturally feel a sense of loyalty towards their family and friends and have felt this way as long as people have been around. Patriotism is not as much a natural instinct but something developed by years of living in a state. This is how Creon developed his opinion on the burial. By living in Thebes his whole life, he has become so attached and dedicated to the state that he has forgotten his natural loyalty to his family. This is why he couldn’t see things from Antigone’s point of view yet eventually realized his mistake and tried to change his actions. Creon was able to change his mind and try to free Antigone in the end because loyalty to family is in human nature and is much more instinctual, and your instincts will always be a part of you. He tried to bury those feelings - his loyalty towards his personal relationships - but here are some things which are so much a part of what makes us human, that there is no way to get rid of them.
